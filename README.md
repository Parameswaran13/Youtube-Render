YouTube Data Scraping with Python: An End-to-End ETL Marvel

🌟 Behold an impressive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline project fueled by the YouTube Data API! and is presented in streamlit app.

🕵️ Using the powerful YouTube Data API, I meticulously scraped essential channel details, making sure no byte of information escaped my grasp. 

🚀 But that's just the beginning! Data is more than just numbers and words – it's art waiting to be painted. I harnessed the transformation capabilities to create a SQL masterpiece, enabling exploratory data analysis based on the requirment.

I have created a simple Streamlit UI for this project. 

Please take a look at my code to get more info.

Thank you for taking a peek behind the curtain!
